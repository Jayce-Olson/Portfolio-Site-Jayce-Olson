# Hello! This is the repository for my portfolio website!

Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions for how I can improve it. Enjoy!

You can view the website at JayceOlson.com

## Tech stack

This website uses Angular and TypeScript for the frontend, while the backend is driven by Go.

## Info

This website took me upwards of 150 hours to build. This was mainly due the multiple versions I created, this final website is one of four other portfolios that
I have created.

Some of the components/effects on the website were discovered on codepen and were modified. I have links to the original components within the code and will link them
below
